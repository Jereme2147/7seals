                <ul>
                    <li>7.27<br>Alternate movEments. Hold KB however you choose.  Coach chooses standards for v-ups. I've found 
                        them to vary a lot between athletes.</li>
                    <li>7.29<br>Test 1: Helen. Helen is pretty straight forward. Push for unbroken sets. If that's not an option 
                    then that is their personal focus for the cycle.</li>
                    <li>7.30<br>Strength: Test 2. 3 reps touch and go deadlift. Focus here should be on 3 PERFECT reps.  If the core breaks 
                    on rep 3, then it doesn't count.<br>
                    Strength Part 2: In whatever order works best for these.</li>
                    <li>7.31<br>For this metcon, don't expect I high completion rate. Many won't see burpee one. Kb for lunges can 
                    be held any way you choose. <br>
                    Optional: Honstly, if they have enough for this part they didn't give enough for the wod.</li>
                    <li>8.2<br>For this, choose the hardest possible MU progression. Not just burpee pull ups. We want to work towards 
                    that MU.</li>
                    <li>8.3<br>Reps are divided however you choose. Both athletes run WITH the plate.</li>
                    <li>8.5<br>The pain and fail is clear.</li>
                    <li>8.6<br>Not much to add. Very similar to a recent wod with cleans. The situps will be the sticky point.</li>
                    <li>8.7<br>Part 1: The first 5 minutes is from a deficit. Standing on a 10lb plate. The next 5 is standard.<br>
                    Part 2: No time domain. Load split squats however, and front foot should be on a 10lb or larger plate. (notice, not 
                    bulgarian split squats)</li>
                    <li>8.9<br>Metcon is meant to be all out, just smoke your lungs.</li>
                    <li>8.10<br>5 four minute amraps. Each Amrap begins with both althetes running 400m. After that, they divide the reps 
                    as they need to. Score is total of all reps.</li>

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
