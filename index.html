                    <li>10/14<br>Seems clear.</li>
                    <li>10/15<br>Only confusing part is that you add 1 rep every round to the deadlift. I'm really not sure how many 
                    rounds we'll see.</li>
                    <li>10/16<br>Not as complicated as it looks. Start with tabata air squats. Immediately after the last rest on the air squats (4:00) start 
                    the EMOM. This isn't scored. On minute 20, begin the "for time" metcon. Your score is the total time. </li>
                    <li>10/18<br>Open wod 20.2</li>
                    <li>10/19<br>Both athletes carry a plate on the 400. Everything else should be clear.</li>

                            <p>This is optional, but a lot of athletes including myself really benefit from this. Just spend some time before a run or even

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
