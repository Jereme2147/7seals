                    <li>9.23<br>Diane is pretty clear.  Scale to keep times under 10 if possible.  Second part is optional.</li>
                    <li>9.24<br>Strength: Find a safe but challenging weight. Should be static. <br>
                    Metcon: hold the db however you choose for the lunge.</li>
                    <li>9.25<br>Score is total time including rest.  This is hard to say a time frame for. Consider a 30m cap. </li>
                    <li>9.27<br>Death by's should be 10-12 on the first one, maybe 10 on the second.  Rest 3 minutes between death bys.</li>

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
