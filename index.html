                <ul>
                    <li>8.26<br>Not much to say.  It could be done unbroken. My guess is after 48 unbroken pull ups, you grip 
                    wouldn't allow for 84 unbroken KB swings.  ***NOTE*** I would like to see emphasis on KB swing form.  I have 
                    seen so many bent elbows at the top of the swing. Not just slightly, I'm talking like 45 deg bends. Lets get 
                    lock out going.</li>
                    <li>8.27<br>Strength: Sounds complicated, isn't.  Just use a 25lb plate under the bar on both sides.  Looking to 
                    start the pull 2+" higher than normal.<br>Metcon: This is just going to be miserable. Scale if rx weight is more 
                    than 75% of their 1rm. </li>
                    <li>8.28<br>Not much to say except to continue my quest to get people to do a proper KB front rack. I can't stress 
                    this enough, from the top of the shoulder is a different thing.  It's cheating. KB front rack is fist under the chin, kb 
                    in the bend of the elbow.</li>
                    <li>8.30<br>This is a wod from Postal. It's not complicated.  It's 3 rounds that are 7 minutes each.  Each round begins 
                    with a 1000m row buy in, then in the remaining time: AMRAP pistols and DU's. Rest 3 min between rounds. Pistols are 
                    weighted.  Hold DB however you choose.</li>
                    <li>8.31<br>Straight forward.  Alternate rounds.</li>
                    <li>9.2<br>We've all done this one. Good luck. Anything under 40 is not bad.</li>
                    <li>9.3<br>Strength: Be cautious of weight here.  It's not the first 10 reps we're looking for here.  It's the last 5. 
                    The last 5 will test core, grip, back.  The idea is not to get hurt and build the muscles that workharder when the primary 
                    muscles fatigue.<br>
                    I have no idea. I honestly don't see anyone getting 15 minutes.  KB swing is a 2 second rep when done right. Same as 8.26, 
                    lets get good swings.  Bent elbows = NO REP.</li>
                    <li>9.4<br>I think this is clear.</li>
                    <li>9.6<br>suck</li>
                    <li>9.7<br>Teams of 2, forgot that part.  400m lunge buy in.  All work is divided as you choose.</li>

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
