                <ul>
                    <li>9.7<br>Teams of 2, forgot that part.  400m lunge buy in.  All work is divided as you choose.</li>
                    <li>9.9<br>Strength: Looking for a tough but safe touch and go weight.<br>
                    Metcon: KB swings should probably be unbroken.</li>
                    <li>9.10<br>Split squat should be BB back rack. </li>
                    <li>9.11<br>This is a wod I came up with. Each rep count has a meaning. 
                        <br>My time frame is totally a guess.  Looking at median athletes, I would expect burpees 
                        to be 10 min, double unders to be 5 give or take 2 either direction.  Step up I have no idea. 
                        I see I forgot height. 24/20. I feel like 4ish minutes.  Row will be 8-10m.</li>
                    <li>9.13<br>Strenght is clear. <br>Metcon: This is intended to be a full on sprint. 
                        Unbroken clean and jerk, pushed run.</li>
                    <li>9.14<br>Teams of 4.  All weights and heights are usual.  This is relay style just like we usually do.  
                        Don't move to the next exercise until the person in front is done. New round doesn't begin until all 
                        are finished. </li>
                    <li>9.16<br>Fairly obvious and tested. </li>
                    <li>9.17<br>Strength: Should be touch and go. <br>More strength: Actually this is clear too.  There's plenty
                     of time to finish if rest periods are kept to a minimum.</li>
                    <li>9.18<br>The clock does not stop.  Just think of this as getting crushed before the sprint wod. </li>
                    <li>9.20<br>Not much to say. Nancy with a little Helen. </li>
                    <li>9.21<br>Alternate rounds. Both run at 5, 10, 15</li>

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
