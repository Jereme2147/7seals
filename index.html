                    <li>7.15<br>Box step ups are alternating and 20" for all.</li>
                    <li>7.16<br>50-65% on squats. For the pushups, feet are elevated on 2 45lb plates.</li>
                    <li>7.17<br>The last round should be with a weight you can't touch and go.<br>
                        Metcon: Will be 10m for those who can handle the weight. If you can't tng with the weight, scale down.</li>
                    <li>7.19<br>Clear. Metcon: Total guess on the time.</li>
                    <li>7.20<br>While partner A is completing rounds, partner B is running 400.</li>
                    <li>7.22<br>ReTest 1: See Friday for rain delay.<br>
                        Optional: if there's time, do the getups.</li>
                    <li>7.23<br>ReTest 2: Very clear. <br>
                        Strength: Weight the split squats however you choose. I'd use the benches for rear foot rest. Weight the 
                        single leg romanian deadlifts however also.  Prioritize form over weight.</li>
                    <li>7.24<br>All the swings are single arm russian. Strangly enough the suitcase DL gets quite tiring.</li>
                    <li>7.26<br>Back up day for retest 1. Wod is pretty clear.</li>
                    <li>7.27<br>Alternate movEments. Hold KB however you choose.  Coach chooses standards for v-ups. I've found 
                        them to vary a lot between athletes.</li>

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
