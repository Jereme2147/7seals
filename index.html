                <ul>
                    <li>8.12<br>This is pretty clear.  All thrusters are per side. Please push proper KB front rack. 
                    Kb sits in the bend of the elbow, fist tucked under your chin.<br>
                    Optional: I know for sure I wouldn't have any interest in this after that workout. But, if they do:
                    Just pick up something heavy and carry it. Sandbag, DB's heavy barbell....</li>
                    <li>8.13<br>Skill: Don't spend a ton of time on this. "one lead in" just means you may take ONE step 
                    before jumping.<br>
                    Metcon: Pretty obvious.  Personally I've been discouraging rebounding.</li>
                    <li>8.14<br>Strength: The percentage is just a guess.  Grip should give out before form.  Stop athletes mid set if needed.<br>
                    Metcon: Speaking of grip. With what little they have left, c&j is 5 per side. Not two DB's. Scale MU's to 9 MU kip pulls.  Lets 
                    focus on training the movement, not just burpee pull ups or something.</li>
                    <li>8.16<br>LOL Just don't come out fast. The lunge CAN be back rack. Honestly, however they want.</li>
                    <li>8.17<br>I'd rather be doing this on my 40th than burning a house. Anyway, Each athlete on the team 
                    has an object to carry for 1000m.  They can trade off, whatever.  The objects are 1 sandbag, 1 plate, 1 KB.  Probably cap it, 
                    just in case it runs really long. Team wods are hard to guess.</li>
                    <li>8.19<br>Again, scale the MU to something building towards MU. </li>
                    <li>8.20<br>Strength: First 5 minutes standing on a 10lb plate.  Second 5, standard.<br>Metcon: 
                        Pretty clear, just be sure to keep that correct front rack.</li>
                    <li>8.21<br>Times will be very spread out. I'd like to see games standard push ups. Chest touches, hips/thigh do not.</li>
                    <li>8.23<br>This sucks.  Time frame: I did this 2 years ago with Brookes Brown. We both finished around the 7 min mark. Now, 
                    I'd put me over or around 10.  Scaling, this should be a weight that someone can touch and go for 2-4 reps FRESH. This was 
                    intended to be all singles. Pay attention to the lockout.  Been seen a lot of elbows locked and knees still in the jerk.</li>
                    <li>8.24<br>Same format as in the past.  Athlete 1 runs, then moves to situps.  Athlete 2 starts run after A1 completes. ALL athletes 
                    finish the round prior to a new round begining. </li>

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
