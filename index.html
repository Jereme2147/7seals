                <ul>
                    <li>7.2<br>If athletes aren't quite up to a 9 minute mile, scale the distance to 1200m or whatever.  I'd like to see 2 minutes per 
                    movement at least.  The runs should be considered a sprint.</li>
                    <li>7.3<br>Scale weight first.  On everything.  This is a rough week. I'd encourage athletes to prioritize 1775 or the 7.  The seven
                     was the original hero wod I'd programmed for wednesday.  After we decided to do 1775, I left both. It was a collective decision.</li>
                    <li>7.4<br>This is simple.  Work for a hour. It will hurt. Good.</li>
                    <li>7.5<br>Snatch is dynamic.<br>
                        Metcon: I was concerned about the number of DB's for this. But after the last two days, I'm not expecting a big turn out.</li>
                    <li>7.6<br>This is an emom.  Minutes one and two are static rep movments. The third minute is a full minute of c&j. Divide ALL reps 
                        however you choose.  Score total clean and jerk reps.</li>
                    <li>7.8<br>Weight for the first part is 135/95, second 95/65 for all movements.</li>
                    <li>7.9<br>Pretty clear.</li>
                    <li>7.10<br>If anyone finishes this, they should get a gold star. Or a cookie. Or an invitation to the games.</li>
                    <li>7.12<br>Score double unders. Getups are 1 on each side.  No rx weight on them.</li>
                    <li>7.13<br>One partner is running, one partner is AMRAPing.</li>

                            a row and get the muscles moving and joints loose.</p>

                                    <p>Every movement should be addressed. For example: Cleans. Begin with Burgener warm up or a variation of using pvc. Repeat
                                    with a barbell. Then some weight. By the time the wod starts, everyone should be sweating.</p>
